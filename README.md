# Music Genre Classification with AIüé∂

This model classifies music genres based on audio signals. It was fine-tuned on the
**[music_genres_small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lewtun/music_genres_small)** dataset.

This project leverages the **[Wav2Vec2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large)** model from Facebook, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture for audio processing, to classify music genres. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of music samples to predict the genre of a given audio file.

The repository includes:
- Preprocessing of audio data.
- Training scripts for fine-tuning the Wav2Vec2 model.
- Model evaluation and performance analysis.
- Deployment of the trained model for real-world predictions.
